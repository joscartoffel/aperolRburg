# aperolRburg


This R-package acutally can not do much on its own. And it does not have that many functions. But...
Maybe it can help you figure out what to do in the sometimes stressfull Ausbildung in Marburg. Tell you to keep in mind to also enjoy life while you are at it.
       
So lets get started! \o/
Right now there are 5 functions only :( Who knows if there will be more in the future.
They are the following:
- aperol()
- gintonic()
- kaffee()
- negroni()
- wassollichtun()

So find out what it can do, e.g. by starting with "?aperol" or the second of Kants three iconic questions: wassollichtun()

See you around :)
